# Mantle Agent Pulse — ERC-8004 Adoption Tracker

A research tool that collects, verifies, and reports ERC-8004 agent-economy
adoption data on Mantle Mainnet. Built for the **Mantle Research Challenge**
(Track 1: research paper evidence base, Track 2: research agent/tool submission).

## What It Does

1. **Daily Logger** — Scrapes the [ERC-8004 Explorer](https://erc-8004.quicknode.com)
   for agent registration and feedback counts on Mantle, runs RPC sanity checks,
   and appends a timestamped row to local CSV/JSON logs.

2. **On-Chain Verifier** — Independently recounts agent registrations directly
   from Mantle chain data (`eth_getLogs` on Transfer events from zero address),
   diffs against the indexer's number to catch backfill gaps.

3. **Peer-Chain Comparator** — Collects the same ERC-8004 stats for Base, BNB Chain,
   Avalanche C-Chain, Celo, Ethereum (and every other indexed network).

4. **Agent Density Index (ADI)** — Normalizes agent counts by chain TVL
   (from DefiLlama) to enable fair cross-chain comparison:

   ```
   ADI = (registered_agents / chain_TVL_USD) × 1,000,000
        = agents per $1M of chain TVL
   ```

5. **Report Generator** — Produces a Markdown report with trend charts and
   comparison tables, ready for embedding in Track 1/Track 2 posts.

6. **Optional Agent Registration** — Can register itself as an ERC-8004 agent
   on Mantle (sends a real tx, costs MNT gas — gated behind env var + confirmation).

## Quick Start (< 5 minutes)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zireaelst/Mantle-Agent-Pulse-Daily-Logger.git
cd Mantle-Agent-Pulse-Daily-Logger
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Daily Logger

```bash
python logger.py
```

This will:
- Scrape Mantle's ERC-8004 page for current agent/feedback counts
- Verify the IdentityRegistry and ReputationRegistry contracts via RPC
- Scrape all peer chains from the /networks page
- Compute ADI for each mapped chain
- Append results to CSV/JSON files in `mantle_agent_pulse_data/`

### 3. Run Full On-Chain Verification (Optional, Slow)

```bash
python logger.py --full-verify
```

This adds an independent on-chain agent recount using chunked `eth_getLogs`.
Takes several minutes — run it once before publishing, not daily.

### 4. Generate Report

```bash
python logger.py --report
```

Creates a Markdown report in `reports/` with trend charts and ADI tables.

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
python tests/test_parsing.py
```

## Agent Density Index (ADI)

The key cross-chain comparison metric for the research paper.

### Formula

```
ADI = (registered_agents / chain_TVL_USD) × 1,000,000
```

### What It Measures

**Registered agents per $1 million of chain TVL.** This normalizes for chain size:
a chain with 100 agents and $10M TVL (ADI = 10.0) has stronger relative adoption
than a chain with 10,000 agents and $5B TVL (ADI = 2.0).

### Data Sources

- **Agent counts**: [ERC-8004 Explorer](https://erc-8004.quicknode.com) public pages
- **TVL**: [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com) free API (`api.llama.fi/v2/chains`)

### Interpretation

| ADI Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|
| > 1.0 | High relative adoption |
| 0.1–1.0 | Moderate |
| < 0.1 | Low relative to chain size |

## Scheduler Setup (macOS LaunchAgent)

The daily logger is configured to run automatically using macOS `launchd`, which is more reliable than `cron` (if the Mac is asleep at the scheduled time, `RunAtLoad` ensures it runs when it wakes).

### Setup & Registration
A LaunchAgent plist file `com.mantleagentpulse.dailylogger.plist` was created in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
To load it:
```bash
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mantleagentpulse.dailylogger.plist
```

### Checking Status
To verify the agent is registered and running:
```bash
launchctl list | grep mantleagentpulse
```

### Logs
Stdout and stderr are NOT swallowed. You can inspect the logs at:
- `logs/logger.out`
- `logs/logger.err`

### Unloading
If you need to stop the scheduled task:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mantleagentpulse.dailylogger.plist
```

---

## On-Chain Registration (`--register-agent`)

> **⚠️ This feature costs real MNT gas. Only run it manually.**

### Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Run

```bash
python logger.py --register-agent
```

### Safety Gates

1. **Private key**: Read only from `AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` env var (never hardcoded)
2. **Confirmation**: Shows full transaction details and requires typing `REGISTER`
3. **Isolation**: Never called from the daily logger's default path

---

## Verified Addresses & Endpoints

All hardcoded values are documented in `config.py` with verification dates.

## Day-0 Data Point

The seed row in `mantle_agent_pulse_data/mantle_agent_pulse_log.csv` was manually
captured from the live ERC-8004 Explorer on **2026-06-20**:

- **Agents: 126** | **Feedback: 1,244** | Validations: Coming Soon | Last indexed block: 96,593,016

An earlier fetch (~15–20 min prior) showed **108 agents / 633 feedback events**.
This jump likely reflects the indexer catching up on backfill rather than a
genuine registration burst — which is precisely why `--full-verify` exists.

---

## Design Decisions & Phase 2 Features

- **macOS launchd Scheduling**: Ensures reliable daily execution even if the machine sleeps, avoiding silent failures common with cron.
- **Git-based Data Integrity**: After every successful daily run, a `git commit` is automatically made with the new data snapshot, creating a tamper-evident history.
- **Data Gap Detection**: `logger.py` self-audits before running. If >36 hours have elapsed since the last log, it writes a `gap_detected` row. Missing data is preserved as an honest methodology note rather than silently ignored.
- **Run-Failure Alerting**: If a scheduled run fails due to network or scraping issues, a local macOS notification (`osascript`) is triggered.
- **x402 Volume Limitation**: Tracking Questflow SANTA multichain facilitator volume was attempted but failed due to lack of a public, verified contract address. This is documented transparently in `x402_data_unavailable.md`.
- **HTML scraping over REST API**: The ERC-8004 Explorer's REST API is paywalled (x402). The website UI is explicitly documented as free. We parse the public HTML pages instead.
- **Adaptive chunk shrinking**: `eth_getLogs` calls start with large block ranges and automatically halve when the RPC returns "too many results" errors. This works reliably across different RPC providers with different limits.
- **Binary search for start block**: Rather than hardcoding a start block number, we binary-search for the block at the target date.
- **APPEND-only logging**: The CSV/JSON files are never overwritten, only appended. The seed row is preserved.
- **No fabricated data**: If any source fails, we log `null`/`None` with a note explaining what failed. Never fabricate a data point.
